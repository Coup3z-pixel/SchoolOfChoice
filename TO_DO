		TO DO

The latest computations reveal that there are fairly large critical
sets, at least sometimes, and that things slow down a lot if we search
over all sets of such a size.  A different approach that should work,
and be faster, is to maintain a list of the sets that have been
overallocated, and search over subsets of supersets with one more
element.  This seems to come down to replacing next_subset with a
search over such a list.

The immediate task seems to be the development of the list
infrastructure, followed by hooking it up.  I think a singly linked
list is at least a decent starting point.  For the sake of brevity,
both in memory usage and look up, I think we should represent sets by
their indices.
