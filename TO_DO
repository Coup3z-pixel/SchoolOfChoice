This is a file for sketching the likely course of further development.
Currently the logical ordering of tasks seems to be as follows.

1.  Detection and graceful exit in the event that some bound is exceeded.

2.  Testing and debugging for all existing input files, at various maximum set sizes.

3.  Development of code that defines and utilizes the related matrix.
