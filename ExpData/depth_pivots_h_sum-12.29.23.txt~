This file contains data from an experiment conducted on December 28,
2023, on the number of events of various sorts during the computation.
The three events were:

1.  Trajectory changes, which correspond to iterations of the while
(before_split) loop in the function GCPS_solver_with_guide, and
recursive descents into this function.

2.  Pivots, which are times that theta is modified, corresponding to
invocations of mas_theta_or_find_crit_pair_for_sch.

3.  The sums of the length of the paths in the modification of theta.

The main concern was to learn how fast these numbers increase as the
number of schools increases, and as the number of students per school
increases.  Here is the data:

Preliminary Conclusions

1.  Holding the number of schools fixed, and increasing the number of
students per school, or holding the number of students per school
fixed and increasing the number of schools:
      a. The number of trajectory changes increases roughly linearly.
      b. The number of pivots per trajectory change increases roughly linearly.

2.  The average length of the pivot paths are always between 1 and 2.

3.  I tried choosing the initial theta more cleverly, by having the
school assigned negative one be one that is fully allocated and has
positive total theta, when possible, but this had no effect.
