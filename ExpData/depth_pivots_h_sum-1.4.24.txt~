This file contains data from an experiment conducted on December 30,
2023, on the number of events of various sorts during the computation.
(This corrects data from a couple days ago.)  The four events were:

1.  Computation of linear segments of the combined function (p,barp).

2.  Splits into two subeconomies when a critical pair is encountered.

3.  Pivots, which are times that theta is modified, corresponding to
invocations of mas_theta_or_find_crit_pair_for_sch.

4.  In each pivot there is a sequence p_0, i_1, p_1, ... , i_h, p_h.
The number h_sum is the sum over all pivots of the number h.

The main concern was to learn how fast these numbers increase as the
number of schools increases, and as the number of students per school
increases.  Here is the data:

Preliminary Conclusions

1.  Holding the number of schools fixed, and increasing the number of
students per school, or holding the number of students per school
fixed and increasing the number of schools:
      a. The number of segments increases roughly linearly.
      b. The number of pivots per segments increases roughly linearly.

2.  The average length of the pivot paths are always between 1 and 2.

3.  I tried choosing the initial theta more cleverly, by having the
school assigned negative one be one that is fully allocated and has
positive total theta, when possible, but this had no effect.
